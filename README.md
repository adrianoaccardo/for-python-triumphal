# suno-mini-mvp

Repo minimale per creare una UI tipo "Suno" che fa:
- TTS (parlato) funzionante su CPU usando Silero (torch.hub).
- Text→Music: integrazione pronta per MusicGen (richiede GPU / Colab; il codice è pronto).
- Gradio web UI per provare tutto in locale o in Codespaces.

Cose importanti:
- Il TTS con Silero funziona su CPU in Codespaces/locale (clip brevi). È vero TTS, niente placeholder.
- La generazione musicale (MusicGen) richiede GPU per essere pratica; ho incluso integrazione reale che funziona se installi `musicgen` e hai GPU o su Colab.
- Non includo pesi proprietari: il codice scarica modelli open-source dal loro hub quando necessario.

How-to (locale)
1) python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate   # Linux / Mac
   .venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2) python app.py
   Apri http://localhost:7860

Codespaces / Gitpod
- Pusha questi file nel repo, poi apri il repo in Codespaces (Code → Open with Codespaces) su branch suno-mvp.
- Il devcontainer installerà le dipendenze base. Nota: Codespaces non fornisce GPU di default.

Se vuoi generare musica in GPU gratis: usa il notebook Colab che preparo (scrivi "COLAB") e lì MusicGen girerà.


# 🐍 for-python-triumphal

Welcome to my personal repository documenting a structured and intentional journey into the world of computer science and software engineering. After finally carving out the time, I'm diving deep into foundational concepts, practical skills, and real-world applications.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repo serves as a living archive of my learning process. It's not just a collection of code—it's a reflection of growth, experimentation, and curiosity. Through platforms like Coursera, edX, and others, I'm building a solid base in:

- Programming fundamentals (starting with Python)
- Data structures and algorithms
- Software architecture and design
- Web development and APIs
- Machine learning and AI foundations

---

## 🛠️ Structure

The repository is organized to mirror my learning path:
📁 /courses         → Notes and exercises from online courses
📁 /projects        → Self-contained mini-projects and experiments
📁 /snippets        → Reusable code patterns and utilities
📁 /docs            → Reflections, diagrams, and technical writeup

Each folder is versioned and annotated to track progress and evolution.

## 🧠 Philosophy

This isn't about rushing through tutorials or chasing certificates. It's about depth, clarity, and building something meaningful. Every commit is a step forward. Every bug is a lesson. Every refactor is a refinement of thought.
